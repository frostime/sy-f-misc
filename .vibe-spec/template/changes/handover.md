HANDOVER PHILOSOPHY:

This file is a TIME BRIDGE — it carries context from this session to the next.

Bad handover = Next session wastes 30 minutes asking "what was I doing?"
Good handover = Next session starts coding in 30 seconds.

Write for your future self (or another AI) who has ZERO memory of this session.

Critical test: "If I got hit by a bus, could someone else continue from this handover?"
