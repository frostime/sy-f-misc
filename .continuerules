This is a SiYuan Note plugin project using:
- SolidJS framework
- @frostime/solid-signal-ref library for easier use of solid signal
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frostime/solid-signal-ref
- SiYuan API and types
- SiYuan CSS classes (prefixed with b3-) and CSS variables

Project Structure:
- `src/`: Contains the source code.
- `src/libs/`: Houses common libraries used across plugins.
  - `src/libs/components/`: Contains shared solidjs components.
- `src/func/`: Includes functional components. This plugin provides multiple distinct functions, each organized in its own folder/file.
- `types`: Handles type declarations. The project utilizes global types for shared common types.
  - `src/types/*.d.ts`: Contains all shared types.
  - `src/func/gpt/types.ts`: Includes shared types specific to the GPT function.

Code Conventions:
- Prevent excessive changes; focus on targeted, effective modifications
- Preserve existing comments and documentation
- Maintain code that's not directly related to the current task
- Follow SolidJS best practices for component lifecycle and reactivity
- Use SiYuan theme variables when create html elements/components for consistent styling
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing
  - If you find any undefined types in some code file and not sure what it might be, you can check the types definition files in the type declaration files.
- The project will be finnaly compiled into a single file, so NEVER USE DYNAMIC IMPORT `await import()`
